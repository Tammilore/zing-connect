## Identity Verification

The Identity Verification endpoint provides a range of fields to verify user identities, supporting KYC (Know Your Customer) processes and user verification. This endpoint can be utilized to auto-complete account data, aid in fraud reduction, and gather personal information such as the user's full name, email address, phone number, gender, date of birth, and Bank Verification Number (BVN). These details assist in identifying users associated with specific financial institutions.
