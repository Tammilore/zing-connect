## Checklist

Here are some important steps for you to set up your account and get started.

- **Log in** - Log in to the Console with your credentials.

<Note>If you don't have an account and would like to get access, request for it [here](https://tally.so/r/mKpkWV).</Note>

- **Update your webhook** - Update your live webhook URL so you can receive and process event updates in real time.
- **Copy your widget link** - Copy your link from the Console and share it with users to connect dummy accounts in sandbox mode and real accounts in development mode.
- **Access your API Keys** - You will need your keys to make requests to fetch data on the accounts that you have connected in any environment.
- **Make your first request** - Make your first request in the sandbox mode to fetch test data and then move to the development environment to fetch real data and complete your integration.
- **Request to go live** - When you are done integrating and testing, head to the [Environments](https://console.zingfi.co/environments) tab and request to go live.
