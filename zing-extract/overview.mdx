Zing provides access to financial data like account details, transaction history, income, identity and employment in real time by allowing users sign into their preferred accounts via our simple no-code widget and share their data with your business. 

Hereâ€™s a summary of what happens:

Your customer selects a provider type and authorizes access to his account. We immediately pull data from the connected account depending on what provider type was selected; whether bank, payroll, crypto, wallets and then send you a webhook notification within 1 - 3 minutes.

```javascript ACCOUNT_CONNECTED
{
  "event": "ACCOUNT_CONNECTED".
  "data": {
            "account_id": "4cc7dd22-4a3e-430d-8419-8c2a1d69d12e",
            "name": "Ololade Daniels",
            "provider": "bento",
            "type": "payroll",
            "created_at": "2023-07-01 00:00:00"
  }
}
```
The webhook object contains the `account_id` of the newly made connection which you can use to call any of our other endpoints and fetch data on the user.
