description: Get started with Zing's extractor
---

Zing Extract is our tool that allows businesses accept manual uploads of bank statements and the likes from their customers who prefer not to link their financial accounts via the Connect Widget.

Here’s how it works:

## Step 1: Run the extract endpoint

```javascript ACCOUNT_CONNECTED
{
  "event": "ACCOUNT_CONNECTED".
  "data": {
            "account_id": "4cc7dd22-4a3e-430d-8419-8c2a1d69d12e",
            "name": "Ololade Daniels",
            "provider": "bento",
            "type": "payroll",
            "created_at": "2023-07-01 00:00:00"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Fetch the job

Get the job-id from the previous request and use it to run this endpoint. There are three possible responses you could get depending on the status of the job. If the job is complete, you’ll get the full data extracted from the uploaded bank statement or payslip. If the job is still running, we’ll let you know and you’ll need to check back in a few seconds, however, this hardly happens. On the very rare occasion that your extraction failed, we’ll let you know as well. If your extraction fails, this could be as a result of an invalid file format or files larger than we currently allow.

### Extracted Data

Extracted data may differ slightly across providers types but they are largely similar. For example, while a Kuda Bank extracted data might include transaction category and extracted data from GTBank does not, you can be sure that they both have similar data like `account_name`, `account_number`, `credit` etc. 

You can call the endpoint to retrieve a job as many times as you like without charge. We only charge you when make a request to extract data from a document.
