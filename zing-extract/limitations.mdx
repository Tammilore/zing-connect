title: Limitations
---

While we’re continuously working to improve the product, there are a few limitations that you need to take note of. We also welcome any feedback or suggestions that can help us with these improvements.

- **Large Files** - We currently do not support files with more than ten pages
- **File Format** - The extractor can only process pdf files, ensure that you verify the file format before running requests on the API. Also make sure it is not password protected
- **Accuracy** - Data extracted from documents are accurate but we’re still working on being 100% perfect so you may get some unsure values on very rare occasions. If you do, please don’t hesitate to reach out or help us improve by [rating the accuracy of your results](/zing-extract/contribute).
- **Different formats across providers** - Data across the different providers are largely similar but may differ slightly. For example, while Access Bank transactions have data for `date`, `credit`, `debit`, `balance` and `narration`, Kuda Bank has the same but with an added data field for `category`.
    
     Another example is that while the date for Access bank may be written as `05/07/2023`, the date for Kuda could be written as `July 7th, 2023`. We’re working on unifying this so you don’t have to.
    
- **No test mode** - You can only use Zing Extract with real documents on the live environment but we’re offering you your first 500 pages free to get started.
