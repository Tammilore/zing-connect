## Overview

Zing uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate client errors, and codes in the `5xx` range indicate a server error that we will immediately work to fix.

## Status Codes
