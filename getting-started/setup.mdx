## Assets

On ChainPatrol, we track crypto-related items like URLs, contract addresses, and wallet addresses.
These items are called **assets**. Assets can be added to the ChainPatrol database by organization owners.
Typically, we'll add the assets for you during your onboarding process.

All reports are first reviewed by an admin in your organization. Then,
the ChainPatrol team will review all proposals to make sure accidental
reports and false positives donâ€™t make it through.
