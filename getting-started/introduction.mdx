## What is Zing?

Zing is a payroll data and infrastructure company that allows businesses fully unlock and utilize the benefits of payroll data. Our flagship product, **Connect**, makes it easy for you to access user-permissioned data from payroll accounts via your application. Once your customers give you access, you’ll be able to perform functions like verify income, employment and identity details, automate payments and much more.

Currently, we’re in pilot phase with the first feature, **Verify**, which allows businesses to accurately verify employment, income and identity for their users, improving the overall user experience and enabling more informed decision making.

As one of the first payroll data infrastructure products available in Nigeria, Zing Connect gives businesses access to payroll data from top providers. We currently have a network of over 7 providers representing at least 200,000 employees with more providers and employees being added from time to time.
