## What is Zing?

Zing is an open finance infrastructure that provides businesses with access to financial data from multiple sources; bank accounts, payroll, wallets, investment apps, crypto and more. Our flagship product, Connect, makes it easy for you to access user-permissioned data from any source via your application. Once your customers give you access, youâ€™ll be able to perform operations like verify their identity, income, employment, banking details and much more.
