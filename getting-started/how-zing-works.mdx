title: How Zing works
---

Zing provides access to payroll data (income, identity and employment) in real time by allowing users sign into their payroll account and share their data with verified businesses. Here’s an overview on how Zing is implemented:

## Connect to a payroll account

Start by accessing your **Zing Link** on the Console. This link takes care of everything from requesting and informing your users about consent to access their data, authentication, credential verification and handling errors from all the providers available on Zing.

We’ve designed Link so it can be easily embedded into any part of your application. You can equally share share it directly with your users by sending them the URL.

## Fetch payroll data

On Zing, you can retrieve income and employment data shared by your customers by using the API or you can access the data through the [Playground](https://zingfi.co) which is essentially a no-code way for you to be able to view and manage your data on your dashboard.

### Using the playground

Zing simplifies the payroll process by providing each company with a dedicated wallet for storing payroll funds, calculating the net salary of each employee, all company benefits, taxes and fees and then making payment to all parties and remitting tax. This can either be on a specific day set as payday by the company or when the company runs the payroll manually.
