title: How Zing works
---

Zing provides access to payroll data (income, identity and employment) in real time by allowing users sign into their payroll account and share their data with verified businesses. Here’s an overview on how Zing is implemented:

## Connect to a payroll account

Start by accessing your [Zing Link](https://console.zingfi.co/link) on the Console. This link provies a widget takes care of everything from requesting and informing your users about consent to access their data, authentication, credential verification and handling errors from all the providers available on Zing.

We’ve designed Link so it can be easily embedded into any part of your application. You can equally share share it directly with your users by sending them the URL.

## Fetch payroll data

On Zing, you can retrieve income and employment data shared by your customers by using the API or you can access the data through the [Playground](https://console.zingfi.co/playground) which is a no-code way for you to be able to view and manage your data on your dashboard.

### Using the playground

To use the Playground, simply navigate to the page on the Console. There you will find a preview of the link widget as well as test credentials for testing in sandbox environment and a way for you to run requests directly from your account. With the playground, all you need to do is provide the `account_id` of the user and select what data you want to fetch. The request is then generated for you and the results displayed on the page. No-code required.

### Using the API

To use the API, you can find the different endpoints under the [API Reference](/api-reference/generate-token) in this doc. To run all requests, you must first generate a token using the token endpoint.
