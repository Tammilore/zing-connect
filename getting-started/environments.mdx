title: Environments

Zing has three major environments, all of which share the same functionality but have some differences. The three environments are Sandbox, Development and Live. Each of these environments have **separate API Keys** which you can find on the [Console](https://console.zingfi.co/api-keys). You should use the Sandbox environment for tests and the Development and Live environments for real connections. 

## Sandbox
```
https://api-sandbox.zingfi.co
```

* **Data Fields** - All data fields are returned in the sandbox environment. 
* **Link** - The widget link for the sandbox begins with `https://demo.zingfi.co?uuid=[Link ID]`
* **Connections** - All connections made in sandbox mode are simulated with dummy data. You can make an unlimited number of calls and connections with no charge.

### Sandbox Credentials
To test in the sandbox environment, you'll need credentials to sign in to the payroll accounts on the widget before calling the API to fetch data.

<Info>
  
**email/phone/username**: test_user
  
**password**: 123456#
  
</Info>

## Development
```
https://api.zingfi.co
```

* **Data Fields** - All data fields are returned in the development environment. 
* **Link** - The widget link for development begins with `https://connect.zingfi.co?uuid=[Link ID]`
* **Connections** - All connections made in development mode are real and return live data. In this environment, you can connect 20 real accounts free of charge.

## Live
```
https://api.zingfi.co
```

The live environment is just the same as the development environment except here you can now connect an unlimited number of accounts. All account connections and calls here are charged.
