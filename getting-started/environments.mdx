title: Environments

Zing has three major environments, all of which share the same functionality but have some differences. The three environments are Sandbox, Development and Live. Each of these environments have separate API Keys which you can find on the [Console](https://console.zingfi.co/api-keys). You should use the Sandbox environment for tests and the Development and Live environments for real connections.
